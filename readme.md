## Code for the Gestalt vs IC melodies experiment  

Melody generation: guide and demo in the jupyter notebook under `melody_generation` folder. This generates `midi` files which can be converted to `mp3` using `convert_to_mp3.sh`. The generation files also produces some analysis figures.

Online experiment source code is in the `experiment_scripts` folder. Audio files for different tonics are in the `experiment_stimuli` folder (see `stimuli_examples` for examples). Both were uploaded to cognition.run.

Requirements in `environment.yml`.
